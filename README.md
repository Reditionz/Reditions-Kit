# Redition's Mega Game Kit Introduction
First released somewhere in February of 2023 the kit was mainly focused on bringing DOORS assets for other people to use and only meant for decoration rather than copying entire scripts and other mechanics from the game, it was and still is only models with no scripts or other game functions.

The kit was first announced on Redition's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WaifuDestiny) channel in February 12 2023 and quickly gained the attention of many people reaching over 300 likes and around 8.9k views in a short span of time. The kit was finally released on February 15 2023 with it's official Discord server that got over 250 members in it.

Soon enough the kit was starting to run out of assets from the actual doors game and on release 3.0 assets from "Pls Donate" and "Booga Booga" were added into the kit with the DOORS assets, this is the current version of the kit however version 4.0 is soon going to be released somewhere in 2024.

The DOORS kit was rumoured to be discontinued about 2 times but it's next large release 4.0 is still in the works and being actively upgraded.
